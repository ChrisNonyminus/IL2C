## What's this?

* IL2C is a translator (transpiler) of ECMA-335 CIL/MSIL to C language.

* We're aiming for:
  * **Better predictability of runtime costs**  
  Better human readability of C source code translated by IL2C.
  * **Very tiny footprint requirements**  
  We are thinking about how to fit from large system with many resources to tiny embedded system.
  * **Better code/runtime portability**  
  Minimum requirement is only C99 compiler.
  * **Better interoperabilities for existed C libraries**  
  You can use the standard .NET interop technics (like P/Invoke.)
  * **Containing seamless building systems for major C toolkits**  
  for example: CMake system, Arduino IDE, VC++ ...

## Simple hello-world like code

Original C# source code:

```csharp
public static class HelloWorld
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello world with IL2C!");
    }
}
```

Translated to C source code (all comments are stripped):

```c
IL2C_CONST_STRING(string0__, L"Hello world with IL2C!");

void HelloWorld_Main()
{
    struct
    {
        const IL2C_EXECUTION_FRAME* pNext__;
        const uint16_t objRefCount__;
        const uint16_t valueCount__;
        System_String* stack0_0__;
    } frame__ = { NULL, 1, 0 };
    il2c_link_execution_frame(&frame__);

    frame__.stack0_0__ = string0__;
    System_Console_WriteLine_10(frame__.stack0_0__);
    il2c_unlink_execution_frame(&frame__);
    return;
}
```

## Getting started

We have a only simple [Getting started document.](docs/getting-started.md)

And also you can read a blog post: ["Try writing code using both the Azure Sphere Development Kit and C#" (My blog)](https://www.kekyo.net/2019/01/04/6917).

### IL2C core hacking

IL2C current status is **experimental**, summarized lazy steps:

1. Open il2c.sln by Visual Studio 2017. Your environment requires enabling C#, VC++ and NUnit3 vsix addin.
2. Build with "Debug - AnyCPU" configuration.
3. If this don't show any errors, kick starts unit tests at the Test Explorer (Run All).
4. The unit tests need a long time for the first execution. It's because these tests automatically download mingw platform and run on it.
5. After all tests passed, you are ready to hack!

Note:

* Essentially, the unit tests compare and verify results executed on .NET CLR with results executed by the native code gcc compiled.
* You can see ["tests/IL2C.Core.Test.Target project"](https://github.com/kekyo/IL2C/tree/master/tests/IL2C.Core.Test.Target). The translated code:  ["tests/IL2C.Core.Test.Fixture project"](https://github.com/kekyo/IL2C/tree/master/tests/IL2C.Core.Test.Fixture) of subfolder "bin/Debug/net462."
* About the CI engineering, you can get more information: ["appveyor.yml"](appveyor.yml) file.
* Currently IL2C contains the VC++ project file because it's better for debugging mates. You don't need this because "IL2C.Runtime.vcxproj" project file DOESN'T REQUIRE for any building (manually and CI buildings.)
* If you want to see internal IL2C, I think these slides help you: [Making archive IL2C #6-55: dotNET 600 2018 session slide](https://www.slideshare.net/kekyo/making-archive-il2c-655-dotnet600-2018)
