## What's this?

* IL2C is a translator implementation of .NET intermediate language to C language, and the project for step-by-step designing and video recording.

* IL2C's implementation priorities:
  * Better predictability for runtime cost.
  * Better code portability.

* Public YouTube recorded videos: ["Making archive IL2C play list"](http://bit.ly/2xtu4MH)
  * "How to create IL2C or same tool of IL2CPP? This video contains pure design process through concept and details."

## Very simple translation sample

Original C# source code:

```csharp
namespace il2c_test_target
{
    public class Hoge1
    {
        public static int Add1(int a, bool isTwo)
        {
            return a + (isTwo ? 2 : 1);
        }
    }
}
```

Translate to C by [Milestone 3 version](https://github.com/kekyo/IL2C/commit/d94582a330fbb1aa0d62e73bc78344559abce3c2):

```c
int32_t il2c_test_target_Hoge1_Add1(int32_t a, bool isTwo)
{
    int32_t local0;

    int32_t __stack0_0;
    int32_t __stack1_0;

    __stack0_0 = a;
    __stack1_0 = isTwo ? 1 : 0;
    if (__stack1_0 != 0) goto L_0000;
    __stack1_0 = 1;
    goto L_0001;
L_0000:
    __stack1_0 = 2;
L_0001:
    __stack0_0 = __stack0_0 + __stack1_0;
    local0 = __stack0_0;
    goto L_0002;
L_0002:
    __stack0_0 = local0;
    return __stack0_0;
}
```
