## What's this?

* IL2C is a translator (transpiler) for ECMA-335 CIL/MSIL to C language.

* We're aiming for:
  * Better predictability for runtime costs, better human readability for the IL2C translated C source code.
  * Very tiny footprint requirements, we are thinking about how fit between tiny embedded system and large system with many resources.
  * Better code/runtime portability, minimum requirements are only C99 compiler.
  * Better interoperabilities for exist C libraries, we can use standard .NET interop technics (likely P/Invoke.)
  * Contains seamless building system for major C toolkits, for example: CMake system, Arduino IDE, VC++ ...

## Simple hello-world like code

Original C# source code:

```csharp
public static class HelloWorld
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello world with IL2C!");
    }
}
```

Translated to C source code (all comments are stripped):

```c
IL2C_CONST_STRING(string0__, L"Hello world with IL2C!");

void HelloWorld_Main()
{
    struct
    {
        const IL2C_EXECUTION_FRAME* pNext__;
        const uint16_t objRefCount__;
        const uint16_t valueCount__;
        System_String* stack0_0__;
    } frame__ = { NULL, 1, 0 };
    il2c_link_execution_frame(&frame__);

    frame__.stack0_0__ = string0__;
    System_Console_WriteLine_10(frame__.stack0_0__);
    il2c_unlink_execution_frame(&frame__);
    return;
}
```

## How to beginning

The IL2C current status is experimental. Contributions are welcome but there's nothing the official guide documents.

This is first step for use the IL2C: ["Try writing code using both the Azure Sphere Development Kit and C#" (My blog)](https://www.kekyo.net/2019/01/04/6917), or these steps:

1. Open the il2c.sln by Visual Studio 2017. Your environment requires enabling the C#, VC++ and NUnit3 vsix addin.
2. Build with "Debug - AnyCPU" configuration.
3. If didn't show any errors, kick starts unit test at the Test Explorer (Run All).
4. Unit tests need long time for first time execution. These tests are running with the gcc by automated downloads mingw platform.
5. All test passed, you are ready to hacks!

### Note

* You have to know the unit tests compared and verified results both executed on the .NET CLR and the gcc compiled native code.
* I asked for you have to see in ["tests/IL2C.Core.Test.Target project"](https://github.com/kekyo/IL2C/tree/master/tests/IL2C.Core.Test.Target). It has a lot of unit test code. And if unit tests are success, you can find translated results in ["tests/IL2C.Core.Test.Fixture project"](https://github.com/kekyo/IL2C/tree/master/tests/IL2C.Core.Test.Fixture) subfolder "bin/Debug/net462."
* If you know the CI engineering, you can get more information from the ["appveyor.yml"](appveyor.yml) file.
* Currently IL2C contains the VC++ project file in the folder because it's better debugging mates. The "IL2C.Runtime.vcxproj" project file DOESN'T REQUIRE for any building (manually and CI buildings.)
* If you wanna the IL2C internals, try to read [Making archive IL2C #6-55: dotNET 600 2018 session slide](https://www.slideshare.net/kekyo/making-archive-il2c-655-dotnet600-2018)
