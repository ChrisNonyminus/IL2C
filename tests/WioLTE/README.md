* These code are very preliminary translated code for Seeed WioLTE (JP) arduino environments.
* There're actual proof of P/Invoke combined relations between .NET and C++ code.
  * il2c runtime and translated source code are annotated by "cpp" extension because the arduino environment partially supported C++ (not C).
